        @param channel: The channel to run the game in
        @param guesser: The person who has to guess a word
        @param bot: The bot instantiating this game. Needed for the wait_for method
        @param word_pool_distribution: The distribution of the word pools to be drawn of
        @param admin_mode: Whether to create an extra channel for the admin. Setting to True or False will enable /
                disable the mode, setting to None will check for permissions of the guesser in the channel and
                choose the mode 'smartly'
        @param participants: a List of members to participate in this round.
                If given, only these participants can give hints or abort the game, and the game automatically checks
                if each participant has given their hint(s) to proceed with the next phase after collecting hints
                If left empty, everyone can participate and interact with the round arbitrarily.
        @param repeation: Whether this game has been called as a repeating game by a previous one. This changes the
                info message sent at the beginning of the game to explain why the game has started
        @param quick_delete: whether to delete messages the game has sent already while waiting for a guess. This
                speeds up the bot as we can spread the API calls over a larger amount of time, but potentially
                one prefers to have the chat cleared at the end of the game for a cleaner game experience while
                the game is active. For now, this parameter is always set to True.
        @param expected_tips_per_person: The number of tips the game expects each player to give in the hint phase
                Only applies to games that have a list of participants.
                If so, the game advances to the next phase after collecting hints automatically once each participant
                has given (at least) the number of expected hints.
                If set to a nonzero value, this parameter is used. If set to zero, the game chooses the number of tips
                according on the number of players playing in the game as three, two and one hints for one, two and
                at least three players, respectively

        This is a helper class for the Game class. Each Game has a PhaseHandler that handles its phases. As the game is
        split up in tasks for each phase, each task can tell the phase handler if it has finished, and the phase handler
        can start the appropriate next phase.
        The phase handler is there to ensure that no phase is started twice, the phases are started in correct order
        and that parallele running phases are canceled before the start of the next phase (e.g. if we wait for multiple
        possible actions from a user, we start one task for each possible reaction, and the task who finishes first
        informs the PhaseHandler and the PhaseHandler can then cancel the other job)
